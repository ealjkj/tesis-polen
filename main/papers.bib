publisher = {Omnipress},
address = {Madison, WI, USA},
abstract = {Many modern visual recognition algorithms incorporate a step of spatial 'pooling', where the outputs of several nearby feature detectors are combined into a local or global 'bag of features', in a way that preserves task-related information while removing irrelevant details. Pooling is used to achieve invariance to image transformations, more compact representations, and better robustness to noise and clutter. Several papers have shown that the details of the pooling operation can greatly influence the performance, but studies have so far been purely empirical. In this paper, we show that the reasons underlying the performance of various pooling methods are obscured by several confounding factors, such as the link between the sample cardinality in a spatial pool and the resolution at which low-level features have been extracted. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of max pooling and average pooling, and give extensive empirical comparisons for object recognition tasks.},

abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million
high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different
classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%
which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network,
which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional
layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected
layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating
neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce
overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization
method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant
of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error
rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

It is shown that these theorems are valid not only for real-valued functions but also for quaternion-valued functions. We describe some useful properties of generalized convolutions and compare them with the convolution theorems of the classical Fourier transform. We finally apply the obtained results to study hypoellipticity and to solve the heat equation in quaternion algebra framework.},

This book covers not only the standard topics but also some more advanced numerical methods being used by computational scientists and engineerstopics such as compression, forward and backward error analysis, and iterative methods of solving equationsall while maintaining a level of discussion appropriate for undergraduates. Each chapter contains a Reality Check, which is an extended exploration of relevant application areas that can launch individual or team projects. MATLAB is used throughout to demonstrate and implement numerical methods. The Second Edition features many noteworthy improvements based on feedback from users, such as new coverage of Cholesky factorization, GMRES methods, and nonlinear PDEs.}

 abstract = {Implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes have been widely used, especially in conjunction with spectral methods, for the time integration of spatially discretized partial differential equations (PDEs) of diffusion-convection type. Typically, an implicit scheme is used for the diffusion term and an explicit scheme is used for the convection term. Reaction-diffusion problems can also be approximated in this manner. In this work we systematically analyze the performance of such schemes, propose improved new schemes, and pay particular attention to their relative performance in the context of fast multigrid algorithms and of aliasing reduction for spectral methods. For the prototype linear advection-diffusion equation, a stability analysis for first-, second-, third-, and fourth-order multistep IMEX schemes is performed. Stable schemes permitting large time steps for a wide variety of problems and yielding appropriate decay of high frequency error modes are identified. Numerical experiments demonstrate that weak decay of high frequency modes can lead to extra iterations on the finest grid when using multigrid computations with finite difference spatial discretization, and to aliasing when using spectral collocation for spatial discretization. When this behavior occurs, use of weakly damping schemes such as the popular combination of Crank-Nicolson with second-order Adams-Bashforth is discouraged and better alternatives are proposed. Our findings are demonstrated on several examples.},
