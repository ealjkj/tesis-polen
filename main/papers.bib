year = {2010},

publisher = {Omnipress},
address = {Madison, WI, USA},
abstract = {Many modern visual recognition algorithms incorporate a step of spatial 'pooling', where the outputs of several nearby feature detectors are combined into a local or global 'bag of features', in a way that preserves task-related information while removing irrelevant details. Pooling is used to achieve invariance to image transformations, more compact representations, and better robustness to noise and clutter. Several papers have shown that the details of the pooling operation can greatly influence the performance, but studies have so far been purely empirical. In this paper, we show that the reasons underlying the performance of various pooling methods are obscured by several confounding factors, such as the link between the sample cardinality in a spatial pool and the resolution at which low-level features have been extracted. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of max pooling and average pooling, and give extensive empirical comparisons for object recognition tasks.},

title = {ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks},

address = {Red Hook, NY, USA},
abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million
high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different
classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%
which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network,
which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional
layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected
layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating
neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce
overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization
method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant
of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error
rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},
